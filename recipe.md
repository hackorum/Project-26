Add a dollop of butter to a hot frying pan. Then butter one side of both slices of bread. Place the non-buttered side down in the hot pan. Flip once toasted.
Now add the cheese to the toasted side of both pieces of bread. Once cheese starts to melt, add tomato. Combine and keep flipping to prevent sandwich from burning.
Remove from the pan and cut into 4-dipping strips.
